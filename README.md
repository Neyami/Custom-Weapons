# Custom-Weapons
Various weapons ported to Sven Co-op.

They might not be the latest versions that I've made, but they are working releases

There might be changes made to the game that cause the scripts to fail and there's nothing I can do about it at this time. But the fixes should be simple.

It'll look really messy but should be relatively easy to use anyway.

Hopefully I can make it better in the future, but health reasons and being busy IRL currently prevents me from doing so.

Needs to be put somewhere, such as in a map script.
